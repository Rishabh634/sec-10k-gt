Task 1.1 : Download Data from the SEC-EDGAR
In this task I downloaded data of some SEC 10K fillings of Apple and Microsoft. 
The language I used is python. I choose Python because it has a lot of library such as SEC-EDGAR downloader, pandayas which eases the downloading process.
While downloading the 10K files I used SEC-EDGAR package. I downloaded files in my local systems in .txt format.

Task 1.2 :  Text Analysis
I took data from 10K filings and  used LLM interface by taking API from Google API. I basically used the  Google AI to generate insights from the 10K filings.
I took the data in data-sets in Python so that I could use visualization tools which are available in  Python such as Pandaas numpy, etc . Due to time constraint I created a simple visualization of  graphs using Pandaas and matplotlib.

Task 2 : Construct and Deploy Simply App
I used html for frontend of my webapp. I used the Python code made in task 1.2 with some changes in the backend. 
As stated in the document I input the CIK number from the user and a graph showing Earning Per Share and Time is shown.
I couldnot deploy the app. Video of my deployment can be seen at this link https://youtu.be/CjA2nSLSSYw
